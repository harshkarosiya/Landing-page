## 📌 Project Overview

This project is my **attempt to replicate the landing page UI** provided by Integra Magna for their technical assignment.  

Due to limited resources and my current knowledge of fonts and spacing, this project is **focused on replicating the structure and visual elements**, rather than perfect pixel-level accuracy.

## 🛠️ Features Implemented

- **UI Layout:**  
  - Built using **CSS Grid** as required.  
  - Included multiple cards and sections based on the provided design.

- **Hover Interactions:**  
  - Buttons and cards scale slightly on hover.  
  - Buttons have background color transitions.

- **Interactive Button:**  
  - "Start" button with cursive gradient text.  
  - Floating oval shadow with smooth scale animation on hover.

- **Typography:**  
  - Used **Google Fonts** like `Dancing Script` for headings.

- **Media and Assets:**  
  - Added images and icons to replicate the design visually.

## 🧠 Challenges Faced

- **Positioning Images:**  
  - Many images had **default space** on the right which I couldn’t fully remove.  
  - Aligning elements exactly like the reference design was difficult.

- **MIFGY13 Text:**  
  - Hard to place exactly where I wanted due to container and grid spacing.

- **Fonts and Spacing:**  
  - Limited knowledge made it challenging to perfectly replicate fonts and spacing from the reference.

## 🚫 Known Limitations

- Layout **may not perfectly match the original design**.  
- **No responsive design** implemented yet.  
- Dark/Light mode toggle not implemented (optional bonus).
